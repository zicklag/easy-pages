					Easy Pages is a simple solution for deploying static websites to a variety of backends.
					The idea is that you come here with a zip of your website contents, and we make it as easy
					as possible to publish to a variety of different hosting providers such as GitHub Pages,
					Netlify, Cloudflare, etc.

					Easy Pages is also designed to be leveraged from website creators such as the <a
